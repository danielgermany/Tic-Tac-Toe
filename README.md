# Tic-Tac-Toe
 Coded a game of tic-tac-toe in an hour or less to challenge myself.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
After an hour of coding, I got a complete two-player TicTacToe game programmed. If I had more time, I would:
+ add CPU functionality so a user can play the game with a bot.
+ have more of an OOP (object-orientated programming) approach.
+ use a GUI to display the board
